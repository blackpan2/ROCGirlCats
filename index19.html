	<h1>Developing a Project ft. Cat Gifs</h1>
		<h2>Picking an idea</h2>
			<p>Some of the best projects come out of the idea "I hate it when..." because you are then solving a problem that you have or can relate with and are going to be putting together pieces that you didn't consider before.</p>
		<h2>Putting together a team</h2>
			<p>Now that you've picked an idea try to form a team with a diverse set of skills. Bringing in people with different ideas, backgrounds, and opinions will make your project better because everyone will consider different things important. Such as stressing the importance of quality code versus the importance of deploying all of the features that were apart of the project.</p>
		<h2>Team bonding</h2>
			<p>With the beginnings of a new team and a new project, it is important to take some time and get to know your teammates. Some do this by tackling some <a href="https://www.wrike.com/blog/team-building-games/">small challenges</a> together, in order to bring to light possible areas of miscommunication as well as start the ball rolling with how you all work together. Some teams chose to skip doing this in a formal way, instead choosing to start the project while the team's excitement is high and get to know each other while developing the first release.</p>
		<h2>Planning</h2>
			<p>Before you sit down and start developing everything, taking some time to plan out the project and its different parts is one element to success. For example, it could be helpful to plan out the deadlines associated with small segments of the work so that the team is aware of the expectations for development right from the beginning. If your developing this project for someone outside of yourselves it can be very important to at this time walk through with your customer, the individual you are creating this for or a representative of the people you are making it for, all of the expectations for what your project should do.</p>
			<h3>Elements of a Project Plan:</h3>
				<ol>
					<li>Overview</li>
					<li>Goals & Scope</li>
					<li>Feature List</li>
					<li>Release Plans</li>
					<li>Risk Management</li>
					<li>Metrics</li>
					<li>Process</li>
				</ol>
		<h2>CODING</h2>
			<p>At some point, the team is going to start developing. There are a couple of parts to this.</p>
			<h3>Writing Code</h3>
				<p>Everything starts from somewhere and as with this project, sometimes it is easiest to start by saying "Hello World".</p>
			<h3>Testing</h3>
				<p>With code written, it is important to confirm that the code is going to perform as expected.</p>
			<h3>Refactor</h3>
				<p>Sometimes when creating a project you realize partway through that the initial design was not sufficient or could be better so that it is easier to maintain the project as you go forward. This is called refactoring and it can be a slippery slope sometimes. Keep in mind that the goal of refactoring should be to improve the quality of the code that already exists, do not try to add large new features while you are refactoring. If you are adding a new feature focus on that and then come back to the refactoring you are doing, otherwise, you might find that you're accidentally adding more bugs to the system.</p>
		<h2>Ship it out</h2>
			<p>Creating something for yourself is awesome and if that was the goal congratulations you're done. However, a majority of projects get made for someone else or they are made and then shared with others. This process is called deployment or "Shipping it".</p>
			<h3>Types of Deployment:</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>Local: Download the project and run it on your local machine</li>
				<li>Web: Upload and run the project on a server so that it can be reached from the Internet.</li>
				<li>Cloud: Upload to a cloud service so that it can be reached and scaled as usage increases.</li>
			</ul>
